# Introduction
This is an official guide to the public Pytorch code and model zoo  for the following paper: 

**SemiGMMPoint: Semi-supervised Point Cloud Segmentation based on Gaussian Mixture Models**

# Environment and Setup

This codebase was tested with the following environment configurations. The corresponding version of the installation library is required. You must install these environments independently according to the official documentation: 


---

- Python 3.7.11
- CUDA 11.4
- Pytorch  1.9.0
- GCC version 7.5.0
- [MinkowskiEngine](https://github.com/NVIDIA/MinkowskiEngine) 0.4.3
- [MMCV](https://mmcv.readthedocs.io/zh_CN/latest/get_started/installation.html) 2.0.0

---

Other necessary installation libraries embedded in the source code include the following parts:

---
- grid_subsampling library
- pointnet++ library
- point transformer library
- chamfer_dist library

---

The installation steps are as follows
### 1. Install Dependencies
Install Dependent Package :
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
if you have any problem with the above command, you can Install some key installation packages by:

```shell
pip install torch_sparse==0.6.12
pip install torch_points3d==1.3.0
pip install tensorboard timm termcolor tensorboardX
```

### 2. Install Optional Dependencies

Make sure you have installed `gcc` and `cuda`, and `nvcc` can work.

- Install cpp extensions, the pointnet++ libraryï¼š

```shell
cd openpoints/cpp/pointnet2_batch
python setup.py install
```

- Install point transformer library

```shell
cd openpoints/cpp/pointops/
python setup.py install
```

# Train and Test

## 1. Datasets Preparation

##### S3DIS

Please refer to https://github.com/yanx27/Pointnet_Pointnet2_pytorch for S3DIS preprocessing.

##### ScanNetv2

Please refer to https://github.com/facebookresearch/PointContrast for ScanNetV2 preprocessing.

##### ShapeNetPart

Please refer to https://github.com/lulutang0608/Point-BERT for ShapeNetPart preprocessing.



>  The location for modifying the dataset path is: `SemiGMMPoint\cfgs\...\Name.cfg` and `dataset` data structure.



### 2. Training and Testing examples

The  configuration files  of model and training parameter are in `SemiGMMPoint\cfgs\...`

Example of modifying classifier parameters in configuration files:

```yaml
decoder_params:
    embed_dim: 64
    num_components: 5
    factor_n: 1
    factor_c: 1
    factor_p: 1,
    mem_size: 36000
    max_sample_size: 40
    update_GMM_interval: 5
    update_loop: 5
```

The modification of other runtime parameters , including epochs, batch size, learning rate,and so on, is still implemented in the configuration file.

#### With the GMM classifier

- PointNet++

Setting dataset root path in `train_gmmseg_semseg.py`:

```python
root = ''
```

Use the following code for training:

```shell
cd pointnet2based/
python train_gmm_semseg.py --model gmm_pointnet2_seg_msg --test_area 5 --log_dir gmm_pointnet2_sem_seg
```

Use the following code for testing:

```
cd pointnet2based/
python test_semseg.py --test_area 5 --log_dir gmm_pointnet2_sem_seg
```

- PointNeXt-L

Setting dataset root path  and other settings in `cfgs\scannet\gmmseg_pointnext-l.yaml`:

Use the following code for training

```shell
cd SemiGMMPoint/examples/segmentation
python examples/segmentation/gmm_main.py --cfg cfgs/scannet/gmm_pointnext-l.yaml
```

Use the following code for testing:

```shell
python examples/segmentation/gmm_main.py --cfg cfgs/scannet/gmm_pointnext-l.yaml mode=test dataset.test.split=test no_label=True pretrained_path=<YOUR_CHECKPOINT_PATH>
```

#### SemiGMMPoint in semi-supervised settings

Set data root paths for annotated and unlabeled datasets and other necessary parameters in the configuration file, such as `10r_semi_gmm_pointnext-l.yaml`

Use the following code for training:

```shell
cd SemiGMMPoint/examples/segmentation
python examples/segmentation/semi_gmmpoint_main.py --cfg cfgs/scannet/10r_semi_gmm_pointnext-l.yaml
```

Use the following code for testing:

```shell
python examples/segmentation/semi_gmmpoint_main.py --cfg cfgs/scannet/10r_semi_gmm_pointnext-l.yaml mode=test dataset.test.split=test no_label=True pretrained_path=<YOUR_CHECKPOINT_PATH>
```
